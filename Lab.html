                    <br>
                    <p>The role that games play in our culture is peculiar. Most people have participated in a game at some point in their lives. Despite their widespread use, video games are rarely treated with the same respect as other forms of media like books or films. For the majority, playing video games is like eating chocolate: it's a secret vice. A game, according to the game designer Sid Meier, is "a series of interesting options," which we navigate to choose how the game will play out and reveal our personalities and thought processes. Playing a game is exposition in action.</p>

                <h1>Movies</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>The ability to experience a range of emotions while watching a movie is one of the reasons we like it so much. These include excitement, joy, sadness, intensity, comfort, shock, and nervousness. They enable us to empathize with imaginary characters we've never met before as we watch them struggle, recover, and finally save the day. Films always manage to brighten us up, which is another reason why we adore them. If you feel down, just turn on a happy and cheery cartoon movie to lighten your mood. Likewise, if you need to laugh, just put on an entertaining comedy film.</p>

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I am Powell Payofilin, currently taking up the course of Bachelor in Scienece of Computer Science at the Central Philippine University. I like to do things during my free time, and I try as much as possible not to waste that time by playing games, watching movies and anime, and reading books. I like animals, and I myself have pets, and they are what makes me happy and less tired after a long day of work. I enjoy programming, but due to some circumstances, my time to practice is limited since I am investing more in my lecture studies.</p>
